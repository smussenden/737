Each line has a guess (page) and a correct answer (answer) given some fraction of the question revealed so far (text). Your goal is to predict whether they match. Each guess is the title of a Wikipedia page. To get you started, you have the following columns

row A unique ID for every guess
body_score A measure of the confidence for how well the text of the Wikipedia page matches the question text
page The guess produced
answer The correct answer
text The text so far revealed (randomly chosen)
category The category (could be noisy) of the question
tournaments The tournaments the question was used in 
answer_type The kind of answer of the question (e.g. person, place, work)
corr Whether the guess (page) was correct or not (i.e., whether it matched “answer”)
inlinks The number of inlinks on the guessed Wikipedia page
